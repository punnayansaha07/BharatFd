## Installation ‚ö°

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites üì¶

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Django 3.2+**
3. **Redis** (for caching)

### Steps to Set Up üèóÔ∏è

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/punnayansaha07/multilingual-faq.git
   cd multilingual-faq
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pip` installed. Run the following command to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Database:**

   If you're using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, you may need to adjust your database settings in `settings.py`. The default configuration is set for SQLite.

4. **Run Migrations:**

   After setting up the database, run the migrations to create the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start Redis (Optional, if you're using Redis):**

   If you are using Redis for caching, make sure Redis is running on your machine:

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the application in action.

### Docker Setup (Optional) üê≥

If you want to deploy this project with Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build and Run Docker Containers:**

   You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file to build and run the Docker containers for the project:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   Once the Docker containers are running, visit the application in your browser at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage üìñ

### Admin Panel üéõÔ∏è

You can manage the FAQs directly through the Django Admin panel. To access it, run the development server and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

Login using the admin credentials you created. You‚Äôll be able to:

- Add, edit, and delete FAQ entries.
- Manage translations for each FAQ.

### Adding a New FAQ:

1. Go to the Django Admin Panel.
2. Navigate to the **FAQ** model.
3. Add a new FAQ entry by filling in the **Question** and **Answer** fields.
4. Optionally, provide translations for the FAQ in various languages.

### Using the API üì°

This project provides an API endpoint to fetch FAQs. You can access it by making a GET request to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/faqs/?lang=en
```

Replace `lang=en` with your preferred language code (e.g., `hi`, `bn`, `sw`).

Example request for Hindi:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/faqs/?lang=hi
```

### API Response:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "question": "How are you?",
      "answer": "I am good, thank you!",
      "id": 1,
      "created_at": "2025-02-01T06:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-02-01T06:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Docker Deployment üö¢

### Build Docker Image:

To build the Docker image for the application, run:

```bash
docker build -t faq-web .
```

### Run Docker Compose:

To start the application with Docker Compose (including all services such as PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.), use:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and run the containers, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:8000`.
